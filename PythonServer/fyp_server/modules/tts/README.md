<h2 align="center">Text-to-speech Module (TTS)</h2>

We used this module to convert text into speech. If the user does not know how to pronounce a word, he can enter that word into the system and can hear the pronunciation by clicking volume button. This volume button is shown in the web interface as below.

This is the view of the web application of our project when the word “අම්මා” is entered to the system. The synonyms of the “අම්මා” are shown in the interface. We can find out the translation of each synonym by just clicking the “en” button which is situated in front of each word.

We used existing modules for both Sinhala and English languages, as this is not relevant to the main research area of our final year project.
