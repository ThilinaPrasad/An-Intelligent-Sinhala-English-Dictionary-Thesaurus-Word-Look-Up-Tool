<h2 align="center">Language Translator Module</h2>

We used this module to translate each of the synonym. When a user enters a word to the system, the system will identify the input language and then shows synonyms of the word in identified language. The language translator module is responsible for translating each of these synonyms into opposite language as shown in below.

This is the view of the web application of our project when the word “අම්මා” is entered to the system. The synonyms of the “අම්මා” are shown in the interface. We can find out the translation of each synonym by just clicking the “en” button which is situated in front of each word.

We used existing modules for both Sinhala and English languages, as this is not relevant to the main research area of our final year project.
