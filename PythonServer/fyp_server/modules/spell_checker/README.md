<h2 align="center">Spell Checker Module</h2>

This module is developed by our parallel NLP research group. We integrated this module for our system to check the spellings of the input word (Sinhala) by developing a custom API layer for the other group Sinhala spell checker application. With this implementation user can check whether the entered word is correct or wrong. When user typing the Sinhala word in the search box itâ€™s real time check the user input word is with correct or incorrect spellings. If the word is incorrect, then the system will give an error hint to the user by displaying error as below.
