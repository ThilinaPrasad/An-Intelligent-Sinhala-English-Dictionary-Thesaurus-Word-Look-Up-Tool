<h2 align="center">POS Tagger Module</h2>

This is one of the sub modules in our system implementation, developed by previous researcher Mr. Mokanarangan Thayaparan under the Natural Language Processing Centre of the University of Moratuwa. We trained the model on Part-Of-Speech tagged data set and used that model on our system. After we successfully built the model with Sinhala POS trainer, we successfully able to predict the POS tag of new word with 70.21% accuracy with 10 epochs. After we get the model predicted tag for the word we mapped that tag to the displayable tags (Level 1 tags) as below.
