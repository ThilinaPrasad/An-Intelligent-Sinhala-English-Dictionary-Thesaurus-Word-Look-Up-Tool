### FastText Word Embedding Model

#### Introduction

This chapter mainly includes the work carried by responsible team member of the group related to the main task of the research project. For the synonym identification of the research here tried to develop a word embedding model with Fasttext tool. As the first step prepared the data set for the model training by pre-processing the WMT19 (World Machine Translation 2019) common crawl data set. Then trained the word embedding model with the Fasttext. After that for the synonym extraction we used Gensim tool as the VSM (Vector Space Modelling) for the Fasttext model. Then we extracted the synonym words from vector space model based on the cosine distance of the word vectors with word count threshold and similarity threshold.
