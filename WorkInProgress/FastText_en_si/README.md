## How to run
First needs to run the crawing method with 'en FastText to si with madura.py' then it prompt to enter the start and end ranges for the crawler. Then it will save .vec files to 'Output' folder & add vec file name to "new_modles.txt" file.
 
Then we can run "Combine_models.py" script and it will combine all the vector files in "new_modles.txt" and add the final model to Combined folder.

###### If un wanted file names in "new_modles.txt" be kind enough to remove those.
